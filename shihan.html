                <h1>Who is Shihan Camille Ohan?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                Born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1949, Camille Ohan developed a strong foundation in discipline and respect from an early age.
                At just nine years old, he joined the Wadi El Nil Scouts, where weekends were dedicated to structured activities, fostering teamwork, resilience, and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond his love for running, cycling, soccer, volleyball, reading, and music, Camille was drawn to the art of combat. 
                To nurture this passion in a safe and disciplined environment, his parents enrolled him in karate. 
                His training took place primarily outdoors, where the natural world became his dojo. 
                The sounds of birds, wind, and flowing water heightened his concentration and deepened his understanding of breath control—an essential element of martial arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1967, Camille Ohan immigrated to Canada, where he pursued and successfully earned his bachelor's degree.

            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                "I have observed in Shihan Camille Ohan many personal qualities that go far beyond the basic qualities needed to provide good karate teaching. 
                In addition to the teaching skills needed to manage the coordination of karate teaching, Shihan Camille Ohan has demonstrated a constant commitment to his mission, 
                which aims at the personal and social development of the young people enrolled in his school.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                According to Shihan Ohan, this development at the personal and social levels in young people is done by the transmission of knowledge from the master to the student, and, in parallel, 
                from the parent to the child. Shihan Ohan considers that martial art scan be an exceptional educational lever for young people in search of values.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                For these different reasons, as a psychologist, university professor of psychology and psychiatry, 
                and as a mental health researcher, I firmly believe that the FKCO karate school of Shihan Camille Ohan plays an essential and central role in the intergenerational transmission of knowledge."
